## What is a DIKW Pyramid?
DIKW pyramid shows the relationship between Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom. So, what do the components of this pyramid means?<br>
DIKW 金字塔用很直观的方式给出了数据，信息，知识与智慧这四者的关系。那么，这四个元素究竟应该怎样定义呢？<br><br>

### Data
Data are discrete facts. According to [Russell Ackoff](http://faculty.ung.edu/kmelton/documents/datawisdom.pdf), data are symbols that represent the properties of objects and events. Below are some data:

| data  | data | data |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 12 | 13  | 24 |

These numeric values mean nothing because there are no descriptions or context provided.

什么是数据 (Raw Data)？ 一个简单的例子，几个没有任何意义的数值。

### Information
When the data is attached with specific descriptions, contexts or meanings, it becomes Information. Let us say the above numeric values are temperature readings from a censor (in celsius), then the data now have meanings and becomes information. In addition, trying to match certain patterns over some data is turning data into information as well. <br>
当未经处理的数据被赋予特定的情景或者描述时，这些数据就变得“有意义”起来，因此信息是可以帮助人们回答what, where, how等问题的。再者，如果我们在数据中找到一些规律（patterns），那么这些数据加上我们发现的规律就是信息。

Change of average temperature during 3 days (in celsius):

| day1 | day2 | day3 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 12 | 13  | 24 |


### Knowledge
Then, how can we transform information to Knowledge? Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning. In simple words, knowledge is information with subjectivities like personal insights and experience. For the changing temperature given above, Alice may think that the temperature of day3 is abnormal and the end of the world is coming. However, Bob, a much experienced expert, thinks the temperature of day3 is quite normal and there is no need to be panic. When the Information is perceived by a particular individual, the additional subjectivity during this process transform data to knowledge.

知识就是在信息的基础上加入了主观因素，而这些主观因素跟个人的经验，教育背景等等有关。上面给出的气温的信息，Alice可能会认为day3的气温变化太大，可能世界末日要来了，但Bob (某个气象专家)会认为这是非常正常的，无需大惊小怪。这种看法的差异正是因为两人的知识背景、经验不一样。

### Wisdom
The ultimate explaination for wisdom is the ability of being effective - "doing the right thing". Wisdom is the ability of use knowledge to make "right" decisions and have the common sense of whether the decision is "right" or "wrong", "ethical" or "unethical".
与前三者相比，智慧是一个更为抽象的概念。真正的智慧是会考虑到根据知识所做出决定是否“正确”，在全局上是否对发展有利。
